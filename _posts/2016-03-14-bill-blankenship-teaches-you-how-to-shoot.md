If you have not heard of Bill Blankenship, you just need to know a few of his accolades to know that he understands shooting techniques.  A US Pistol Team shooter and winner of the National Championship 5 years in a row (6 total!) put him as an individual you want to learn from.

In an article he wrote concerning proper shooting techniques, he gave these 'Three Lessons' for anyone wanting to be a better shot.  Proper Sight Alignment, Trigger Control and Learning to Hold Still.
