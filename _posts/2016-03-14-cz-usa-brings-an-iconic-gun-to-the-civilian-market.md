[CZ USA][0], celebrating 40 years with their CZ 75b 9mm, is launching a host of new weapons in 2015 (to include the competitive[Tac II][1]).

One of the most anticipated releases is a civilian ready version of their Scorpion.  This model will be semi-auto and slightly larger than its predecessor. It features ambidextrous controls and the charging handle will be adjustable so trigger reach can be shortened or lengthened depending on the owners needs.

The Scorpion has been seen in movies, video games and in use in private security forces all over Europe, Russia and Asia.  Its iconic design will surely draw buyers from around the world at its release.
