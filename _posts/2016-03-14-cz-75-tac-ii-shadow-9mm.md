Celebrating the 40th Anniversary of the CZ 75b (my favorite range gun),[CZ USA][0]is set to release a big lineup of new weapons in 2015\.  One of the featured releases is the CZ 75 Tac II Shadow 9mm.

The CZ 75b is a popular SA/DA pistol that was one of the 'wonder nines' and is a design that has spawned a large number of cloned designs from manufacturers including Springfield, Magnum Research and FAMAE.  Carried by law enforcement and military around the world, it is also enjoyed by competitive shooters and even the average gun owner like myself.

This year CZ releases the Tac II Shadow, a competition ready version of the 75b.  It features a tuned trigger with a short reset (single action), Trijicon(r) tritium front sight and an ambidextrous manual safety.  The pistol does not have an accessory rail, true to the 75b original design.
